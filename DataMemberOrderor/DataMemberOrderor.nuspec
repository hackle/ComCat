    <description>ComCat is a Resharper plugin that helps with 2 things in C# programming: order DataMember properties in a DataContract; sync comments from interface / base class to implementation / child class.You will need to use the ReSharper extension manager to point to the nuget repository (however this plugin is also available on Nuget Gallery) first in order to install this plugin. It possibly won't work with the Nuget package manager. Go to the project page for more info.</description>
